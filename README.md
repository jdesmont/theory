Viewing nature as a trained network

The idea:

Nature as we experience it is a network (here a neural network would be a specific case of what I call a network) that was trained in the beginning of times and now just outputs our experience from experienced inputs. Phenomenon we experience are the output of this trained network. We attempt to derive general laws from our experience, but really this network is a black box that outputs natural experience with given probabilities. From our point of view, certain probabilities are so high that we are tempted to view the related outputs as general laws of nature (our experience of free fall motion for big objects, for instance), but in certain cases (particle-sized such as where quantum physics currently applies) those probabilities remain low-enough for us to experience this non-deterministic quality of nature.

Follow-up questions:

- Is this network still training itself? If not, why not?

- Can we derive a model of this network through the observation of certain phenomemon, such as: constants in current physical laws, prime numbers, difference in behavior between big and small? wave-matter duality, ... ?

- What is the nature of this network? Is it a mathematical object that works like neural networks? Is this something different? Is it mathematical in nature?

- Could we infer that the existence of other networks that we can experience (such as neural networks / brains) is the consequence of the existence of this "global" network?

- Is the existence of mathematics (hard science) a consequence or an a-priori of this global network?
